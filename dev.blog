Entry #1 — Idea & Research

Date: 2025-12-17
Stage: Project conception

Defined the main problem in the CIS: beginners avoid investing due to fear and chaotic information.

Decided to build a Telegram bot instead of a website — lower entry barrier for my region.

Chose Python because of async ecosystem and finance libraries.

Decisions:

Target audience → Russian-speaking beginners

Core feature → demo-portfolio with virtual $10,000

Ethical focus → optional Shariah-compliance

Learned:
Product should start from people’s pain, not from technology.




Entry #2 — First Aiogram Steps

Date: 2026-01-12

Initialized Aiogram project

Created /start command

Built first InlineKeyboard and Reply buttons

Learned difference between message handlers and callback queries.

Problems:

Confusion between reply_markup types

Bot answered twice because of duplicated handlers.

Result:
Working menu with “Stocks / ETFs / Demo”.





Entry #3 — CallbackQuery Logic

Date: 2026-01-24

Implemented CallbackQuery routing

Separated flows for stocks and ETFs

Understood async handler lifecycle.

Mistakes:

Tried to use show_alert=True in wrong method

Mixed message and callback contexts.

Learned:

Telegram UI = state machine, not just chat.


  

Entry #4 — Architecture Decision

Date: 2026-01-26

Split project into:

handlers

market service

database layer

Added SQLAlchemy async models.

Reasoning:
Didn’t want “one-file bot” → impossible to scale.




  
Entry #5 — FSM Registration

Date: 2026-01-30

Implemented FSM for:

owner name

demo name

Connected FSM with DB.

Breakthrough:
User now can create portfolio step-by-step.





  
Entry #6 — SQL Hell (3 days)

Date: 2026-01-31 – 02-02

Problem:

SQLite schema didn’t update

Error: table has no column named portfolio_id

Attempts:

recreated DB

learned migrations concept

read SQLAlchemy docs

Lesson:
Database ≠ Python model. Schema must be recreated or migrated.






  
Entry #7 — Victory

Date: 2026-02-03

Fixed schema

Registration + login fully working

Portfolios persist between sessions.

Feeling:
First time the project felt “real”.

Entry #8 — yFinance Integration

Date: 2026-02-05

Added real market data

Separated logic for stocks vs ETFs

Discovered that .info is unreliable → switched to .history().

Learned:
External APIs are messy.






Entry #9 — Toward Analytics

Date: 2026-02-07

Designed list of metrics:

P/E

Debt/Equity

EPS

Planned beginner-friendly explanations.
