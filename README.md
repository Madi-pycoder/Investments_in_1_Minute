# Investments in 1 Minute

A Telegram bot that helps beginner investors in the CIS analyze stocks and ETFs in under one minute using structured financial data, AI-powered insights, Shariah-compliance screening, and a risk-free demo-portfolio.

## Personal Motivation

I started investing with about $1,000 and achieved 18%+ return in my first year.  
This experience changed how I viewed money: in the CIS, inflation often makes saving accounts ineffective, yet most young people avoid investing because:

- financial information is scattered and overly complex  
- fear of losing money discourages first steps  
- ethical/Shariah considerations are rarely addressed

As a Muslim high school student from Almaty planning to major in **Data Science**, I decided to build a tool that makes investing:

- understandable  
- ethical  
- data-driven  
- safe to practice

## Problem in the CIS Region

- High inflation reduces real value of savings  
- Lack of structured financial education  
- Social media provides chaotic, often manipulative advice  
- Almost no accessible tools for Shariah-compliant screening

## Solution

A Telegram bot that combines:

1. **Fast analytics** – key metrics in 60 seconds  
2. **AI explanation** – beginner-friendly interpretation  
3. **Shariah filter** – ethical investing support  
4. **Demo portfolio** – practice with virtual $10,000  
5. **Risk awareness** – basic portfolio discipline

## Key Features

- Stock/ETF lookup via ticker  
- Asynchronous SQLite + SQLAlchemy database  
- Demo-portfolio with transactions and positions  
- Shariah-compliance indicator  
- FSM onboarding flow  
- Russian interface for CIS accessibility

## Tech Stack

## My Contribution

I independently:

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project I learned:
